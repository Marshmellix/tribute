  <h1><b>TRIBUTE PAGE OF KEVIN SYSTROM (CREATOR OF INSTAGRAM)</b> </h1>
  <h2>ABOUT HIM</h2>
  <img src="KEVIN SYSTOM.jpg">
  <p>Kevin Systrom (born December 30, 1983) is an American computer programmer and entrepreneur. He co-founded Instagram, the world's largest photo sharing website, along with Mike Krieger.[2]

    Systrom was included on the list of America's Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40 2016.[3] Under Systrom as CEO, Instagram became a fast growing app, with 800 million monthly users as of September 2017.[4] He resigned as the CEO of Instagram on September 24, 2018.[5]
    
    Meta Platforms (then Facebook, Inc.) bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, a large sum at that time for a company that had 13 employees. Instagram today has over one billion users and contributes over $20 billion to Meta Platforms's annual revenue.</p>
  <h3>EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</h3>
  <p>Systrom was born on December 30, 1983, in Holliston, Massachusetts.[6] He is the son of Diane, a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble,[7] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President of Human Resources at TJX Companies.[8][9]

Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child.[10]

He worked at Boston Beat, a vinyl record music store in Boston, while he was in high school.[11]</p>

<p>Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering.[12][7] At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He turned down a recruitment offer from Mark Zuckerberg and instead spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.[13][14] Systrom was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[15] The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually became Twitter.</p>
<h4>CAREER (INSTAGRAM)</h4>
<p>In 2010, Systrom co‑founded the photo-sharing and, later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger[18] in San Francisco, California.

In April 2012, Instagram, along with 13 employees, was sold to Facebook for US$1 billion in cash and stock.[19] According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom US$400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[20] One of the key contributions to the acquisition was that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook was "committed to building and growing Instagram independently", allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram.[21] Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that "we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource".[22]

In an interview with Forbes, he stated that "Instagram is a new form of communication that's an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today's social media world. Instagram's a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or 'like' photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook."[23] Systrom identified Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Activision, Lancôme, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014.[24]

On September 24, 2018, it was announced that Systrom resigned from Instagram and would be leaving in few weeks.[25][26]</p>
